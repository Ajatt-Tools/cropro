This add-on allows you to find and import notes from another profile into your currently loaded profile.
For example, you can make a "sentence bank" profile where you store thousands of cards generated by
[subs2srs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=subs2srs),
and then use this add-on to search for and import cards with certain words into your main profile.
This helps keep your main profile uncluttered and free of large amounts of unneeded media.

This add-on is a continuation of the original
