# Anki Add-on: Cross Profile Search and Import

This add-on allows you to find and import notes from another profile into your currently loaded profile. For example, you can make a "sentence bank" profile where you store thousands of cards generated by subs2srs, and then use this add-on to search for and import cards with certain words into your main profile. This helps keep your main profile uncluttered and free of large amounts of unneeded media.
