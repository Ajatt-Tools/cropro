## Cross-Profile Search and Import

**Anki needs to be restarted after changing the config.**

### List of options:

* `enable_debug_log` - print debug information to `stdout` and to a log file.
Log location: `~/.local/share/Anki2/cropro.log` (GNU systems).
* `max_displayed_notes` - how many search result to display
* `tag_exported_cards` - tag cards in the other profile as `exported`
so that you could easily find and delete them later.
